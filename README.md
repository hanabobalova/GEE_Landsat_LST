Google Earth Engine code to calculate land surface temperature (LST) from Landsat satellites, using the NDVI-based land surface emissivity (LSE).
RTE folder contains scripts for LST calculation using the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) method.
SMW folder contains modified scripts of Ermida et al. (2020) for LST calculation using the Statistical Mono-Window (SMW) method, with the added option of using NDVI-based LSE.
